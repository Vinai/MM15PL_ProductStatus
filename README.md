# Example Magento 2 ProductStatus module

## About

This module was developed during the Magento 2 mini-workshop at Meet-Magento 2015 in Poznan, Poland.

## Features

**New commands for `bin/magento`:**

* `catalog:product:enable` command
* `catalog:product:disable` command
* `catalog:product:status` command

**Enable/Disable products via dedicated web API resource**

* `/V1/mM15PL/product/status/:sku`

The purpose of this command is just to serve as a educational example during the workshop. It is not intended to be used in a production environment. It is not intended to serve as a basis for custom code without the explanations and comments given verbally during the workshop.

The actual workshop time line differed from the order in the workshop-outline file in the doc/ directory, as the module was recreated live also incorporating participant feedback.
